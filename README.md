# tinyshell

# Tinyhshell is a program written in C/C++ that tries to replicate a real shell. It processes all shell commands along with three other commands, namely history, history -sbu and exit, which have been explained below. The code tries to inculcate Object Oriented Programming, STL and the concept of parent and child procceses into it. To run the program, clone the repository and give the following make commands.

# 1. make tinyshell - Compiles the code (generating object code and linking the necesaary files together).
# 2. make run - runs the tinyshell program
# 3. make clean - cleans all the .o files in the directory along with the executable as well.
# 4. make tar - Creates an archive of the all the files into a single .tar file called tinyshell.tgvz


# The commands implemented for this project are:

# 1. history       : Displays the last five commands along with their executiong times.
# 2. history - sbu : Displays the last five commands in the descending order of their executiong times.
# 3. exit          : exits the program
